[miMediation](https://github.com/KiRinHong/miMediation) is a R package for performing phylogeny-based mediation test [(PhyloMed)](https://github.com/KiRinHong/PhyloMed) for microbiome data.

See the following for detailted and up-to-date documentation:

- The [miMediation R package manual](https://github.com/KiRinHong/miMediation/blob/main/miMediation_0.1.pdf).

## Installation

You can install the package from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("KiRinHong/miMediation")
```
You can download the [package source](https://github.com/KiRinHong/miMediation/blob/main/miMediation_0.1.tar.gz) and install it manually with:

``` r
install.packages("miMediation_0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type ="source", dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports")) 
```

## Troubleshoot Dependencies

At this point, there may be complaints about missing dependencies. To install missing dependencies on either [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/install/), start a fresh R session and enter the following:

``` r
# For CRAN
install.packages("missing_package")
# For Biocondocutor
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("missing_package") 
# ... and so on
```

## Re-attempt miMediation Installation

Install again, after dependencies have been installed. You should now be done if the installation was successful.

## Load Package, Explore Function Documentation and Vignette

``` r
library(miMediation)
help(package = "miMediation")
?data.cecal
?phyloMed
?prepareTree
```

If you install the package manually from source, a vignette describing the use of the package is available from within R. Load the package and then use the vignette function.

``` r
vignette("miMediation", package = "miMediation")
```

Otherwise, it will not build vignette by default if you install the package from github because theyâ€™re time consuming and may require additional packages (here, require `prettydoc` R package, install it before building vigentte). You can force building (take ~7 mins) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("KiRinHong/miMediation", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
Then, the vignette would be availabe from within R.
