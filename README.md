devtools::install_github("KiRinHong/miMediation")
```
The Package source can be downloaded from https://tangzheng1.github.io/tanglab/software, which can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages(miMediation_0.1.tar.gz, repos = NULL, type ="source") 
```

## Vignette

If you install the package from source, a vignette describing the use of the package is available from within R. Load the package and then use the vignette function.

``` r
library(miMediation)
vignette("miMediation",package="miMediation")
```
Otherwise, it will not build vignettes by default if you install the package from github because theyâ€™re time consuming and may require additional packages. You can force building with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("KiRinHong/miMediation", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
Then, the vignette would be availabe from within R.
